## Questions
   i. The graphed lines are much flatter, as in their slope is less steep. Yes, the linear lines are plotted much closer to one another.
  ii. The plotted lines are much closer together. There is no drastic change from the last step, (Y_FINAL = 10000), but the lines are closer together.
 iii. As Y_FINAL increases, the quadratic functions get closer together. As the Y bound increases, the lines seem to look more linear.
  iv. As Y_FINAL increases, the linear functions look almost like one line. The quadratic functions have taken visual space of the linear functions, and the linear functions
        look almost like the constant functon.
   v. The quadratic functions look much flatter, almost like constant functions. It is difficult to see them as separate functions.
  vi. In the presence of cubics, the plotted linear functions are almost non-existent, disappearing as the quadratic functions get closer to the X-axis.
 vii. The cubic functions gradually start to look like quadratic functions or almost linear functions.
viii. The quadratic functions look like constant functions as they are so close to the X-axis.
  ix. The linear functions are hard to even see, they seem like they are not even there in the prescence of exponential functions.
   x. The point of these plots is to see the difference in efficiency between each complexity class, and too see the magnititude of the these differences.
        Seeing these plots, it shows how important it is to design our algorithms to be as simple as possible.
