 * This class represents the interface for an object that can

 * normally. Once an object is styled via {@link #style()},
 * the {@code toString()} method produces some styled string
 * representation. In order to have the {@code toString()}
 * method revert to its normal behavior, the object must be
 * unstyled via {@link #unstyle()}. This imposes a state
 * requirement on the underlying object (i.e., styled or
 * unstyled) that is left to the implementation.
